# FM1Tracker Changelog

Git remains the detailed history. This file records milestone-level changes only.

## 2026-10-23 - Phase 0 and Phase 1 baseline work

### Foundation complete

- Frozen V0.1 architecture, control map, data model and engine scope.
- Defined 8 tracks, 64 steps/pattern, 16 patterns and max four parameter locks per step.
- Defined STEP REC, REST and parameter-lock behavior as core future product requirements.
- Full Furnace port explicitly kept out of scope; Furnace is currently reference/interoperability only.

### WP1.1 - Dinghy provenance freeze

- Pinned Dinghy upstream to `d44df7db09b98ccad2f1233b8f83f5f09c04829e`.
- Recorded GPL/OFL provenance and external JieLi SDK requirements.
- Explicitly excluded Dinghy branding assets.

### WP1.2 - Minimal pristine Dinghy import

- Imported the manifest-selected platform/HAL/loader/app/test/build baseline.
- Verified every imported path against pinned upstream Git blob SHA and Git mode.
- Preserved script executable bits and source licensing headers.
- Corrected the import-manifest typo for `firmware/hal/fm1_uart.h`.
- No FM1Tracker tracker/synth behavior added.

### WP1.3 - Pristine baseline verification

- Verified the pristine host harness in GitHub Actions.
- Produced and hashed host WAV and two screen PNG artifacts.
- Verified Dinghy's JieLi toolchain installer and clang 4.0.1 execution.
- Attempted the device firmware build and isolated the remaining build blocker to the external AC79 SDK checkout.
- No physical FM-1 verification performed.
- Detailed evidence: `docs/WP1_3_VERIFICATION.md`.

### WP1.4 - FM1Tracker identity rename

- Checked the current Firmware Hub identity list and selected fixed package identity `FM-1_987`.
- Added `tools/build_fm1tracker.py` as an identity wrapper around the unchanged verified Dinghy build driver.
- Routed `build.sh` through the FM1Tracker wrapper while preserving the existing toolchain/SDK gates.
- Renamed host output artifacts to `fm1tracker*` and compiled visible app name `FM1TRACKER`.
- Added a WP1.4 CI regression gate proving the protected Dinghy app/platform/HAL/loader/build-driver paths stayed unchanged.
- Verified the FM1Tracker host screen identity and produced renamed host artifacts.
- Verified the FM1Tracker WAV is bit-identical to the pristine WP1.3 WAV (`dac1695b8e69f26334d548005e6cae505cf39ace297dcf6a57338e70fc386b9b`).
- Full renamed device package build/resource capture remains WP1.5 and requires the external AC79 SDK checkout.
- Detailed evidence: `docs/WP1_4_VERIFICATION.md`.

### Next

WP1.5 - renamed baseline verification and budget capture. No tracker implementation begins until Phase 1 is closed.
